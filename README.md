# Traffic Recognition Machine Learning Program Documentation

## Introduction

This Python program is designed to effectively identify and categorize traffic signs depicted in images.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python-headless matplotlib scikit-learn
```
These dependencies include TensorFlow for machine learning, NumPy for number crunching, OpenCV for image processing, Matplotlib for visualizing data, and scikit-learn for data prep and evaluation.

# Usage
## 1. Data Preparation
First things first, gather your dataset. Collect images of different traffic signs and organize them into directories, each representing a specific sign category. Make sure your images are in the .ppm format for compatibility.

## 2. Loading Data
Next up, load your dataset using the **load_data** function. Don't forget to specify parameters like the image dimensions (**IMG_WIDTH** and **IMG_HEIGHT**) and the total number of sign categories (**NUM_CATEGORIES**). This function will give you back a handy tuple with all your loaded images and their corresponding labels.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
Before diving into model training, let's prep our data. Split it into training, cross-validation, and test sets using scikit-learn's **train_test_split** function.

## 4. Model Creation
Define your model architecture, including the input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Tweak the number of neurons and activation functions to suit your needs.

## 5. Model Training
Compile the model by picking an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. Then, train it using the training data and keep an eye on its performance using the cross-validation data. Feel free to tweak those hyperparameters to get the best results!

## 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate its performance using the test data. Plotting accuracy and loss curves can give us a good visual on how the model is doing and whether it's overfitting or underfitting.
