# Traffic Recognition Machine Learning Program Documentation

## Introduction

This Python program is designed to effectively identify and categorize traffic signs depicted in images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By employing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, it facilitates the automated recognition and classification of diverse traffic sign variants.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python-headless matplotlib scikit-learn

These dependencies include TensorFlow for machine learning, NumPy for number crunching, OpenCV for image processing, Matplotlib for visualizing data, and scikit-learn for data prep and evaluation.
