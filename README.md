# Traffic Recognition Machine Learning Program Documentation

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my Traffic Recognition Machine Learning Program! With this Python application, I've made it easier to recognize traffic signs using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This program is a key part of my efforts to develop smarter transportation systems, aimed at making our roads safer and more efficient.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python-headless matplotlib scikit-learn
